											Since secondary school, I have wanted to do something related to computers. 
											Electronics gadgets always amazed me in my childhood. I repaired a relative's mobile phone when I was in the 9<sup>th</sup> standard and I used to bring that mobile every day to school just to give a call to the teacher's mobile number while he was teaching in the class. As soon as he picks up I would hang up and the teacher would keep saying hello, hello, hello. The whole class used to laugh and the teacher would scratch his head with confusion. Fun part is teachers didn't catch me for the next 2 years. <br />
											I really don't know, if is it relevant to mention this story here but my journey toward computers / IT started from this scenario.
										</p>
										<p> I went off track in 11<sup>th</sup> ― 12<sup>th</sup>. I got distracted. All the things one can possibly think an ideal college student won't do. I have been there, done that. When I appeared for the 12th board exam, believe me, I didn't even know the color of a single textbook, let alone touch it. We called it a miracle that I passed the exam. 
											I wasn't interested in Engineering, I wanted to pursue bachelors in computer science. So I came to Pune to get my life back on the right track and never looked back.

											If Thomas Edison was from India, he would have never said this.
											Because in India, a piece of paper is everything.
